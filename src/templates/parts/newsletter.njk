<form class="email-form" name="newsletter" method="POST" data-netlify="true" netlify-honeypot="bot-field">
    <div hidden>
    <label>
        Donâ€™t fill this out if you're human: 
        <input name="bot-field" />
    </label>
    </div>
    <label for="email_address">Email address</label>
    <div>
    <input type="email" name="email_address" id="email_address" required />
    <button type="submit">Subscribe</button>
    </div>
</form>
