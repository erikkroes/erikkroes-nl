      <h3>Accessibility Session</h3>
      <p>
        Do you encounter a barrier in my streams? Let me know and I'll chase it. Once a week I stream about Web Accessibility. I prefer to have a guest. Guests can present a topic related to Web Accessibility and/or Web Development.
        If there's no presentation, I'll pick up an open source project to improve while streaming. Wether there is a guest or not, it revolves around sharing knowledge and experience. Please ask questions so we can have a
        conversation. Want to join me? It's like a continuous call for presentations except you can just <a href="#contact">contact</a> me.

        I'm not neuro-typical and have a brain injury after 3 surgeries. My la(te)st surgery was in 2020. It might result in having trouble to focus on multiple things and being tired early. So don't expect me to be fast or stream
        24/7. Follow me on <a href="https://twitch.tv/erikKroes/videos">Twitch</a> for notifications.

          Everybody loves toggle switch on mobile, or so Iâ€™ve heard. But if youâ€™re building a website, how do you reproduce this without excluding people. The result Letâ€™s start with the most important part. This is the end result

        <p>
          Web Components are a newly supported standard. Theyâ€™re a great match for Design Systems because theyâ€™re futureproof and work with any framework. Building proper UI Web Components can be quite a task though, especially if
          you want them to be accessible. Here are some pointers on what to look out for.
