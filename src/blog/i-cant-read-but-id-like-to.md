I have issues with reading books. I find it very hard to read a book. But I used to read quite a lot, and I'd like to get into it again. This is me reaching out, and asking your best tips!

## Why don't you read?
For clarity, I'm not illiterate. I'm not dyslexic either. Reading is challenging for me, mostly because of my traumatic brain injury.
When I'm tired.. no, let me rephrase that. I'm usually tired and low on energy. I try to work 40 hours a week as a contractor (which ends up being more than 40 hours) while having a family and a life as well. I find that to be a lot.
So when I do happen to find a chance to read a longer text (and not grab my phone to read messages, and e-mails, and whatever else feels vaguely job-related)... I'm tired. My attention span will be bad. My capacity for processing information will be low, like a brain fog. Letters and text can actually feel like high stimuli. For example, white text on a black background, on my phone screen, can appear to have depth. Text will feel restless. My nystagmus might also play a role in this.
Everything considered, reading is not a nice and relaxing experience.

## But you would like to read again?
Yes, please! I used to devour books. Most of my vacation luggage used to be books, and I'd still run out. I'd love to feel that love for books again. To get caught up in stories, and not being able to put a book away. 

## What will you do?
From what I've read on the subject so far (which, ironically, included some very unreadable sources) I can try the following:
- Read fiction. I'll stop trying to force myself to read non-fiction. Maybe when I get back into it. 
- Read at a lower reading level. Not all my reading has to be literature. I'm thinking maybe a "young adult"-level? Interesting content but no complicated reads.
- Use my e-reader. I can adjust things like font-size and text per page to cater to my eyes.
- Prefer Dutch over English. English is usually doable, but I might as well give preference to the easier option when given the choice, and when I'm reading for the fun of it!
- I won't force myself to finish a book.
- I will try and read only one book at a time.

I won't be trying podcasts or audiobooks, sorry. While I'm often tempted, my focus when listening might be even worse than when I'm reading.

## And what else?
I don't know? I'm not a reading specialist. I don't usually consider myself vision impaired. I'm asking for tips from those who know more than me!
What can I do to make my attempt at reading more a success? Do you know of any techniques/tools/software or maybe simpler, what books should I definitely read?

Thanks so much for any tips and any feedback. This includes already given feedback on Discord (much appreciated!). You can also [join the Discord server](https://discord.gg/FSRZDPDzrQ) or reply on the platform where you read about this blog. Thanks already!
