Newsletters aren't for me. I do love sharing though. I came up with some alternatives including a Discord server. Let me share with you why I think that's a good idea.

I've seen several people in my "bubble" start newsletters. I think that's great. Moving away from unstable platforms and walled gardens and creating a channel for sharing.
I'd love to run a successful newsletter. But I won't. It's not a good fit for me, or for how my head works.
I've been considering what would work for me instead. This is what I came up with:

* I've set up two sections on my website. One for my blog (which I already had) and one for Notes. Notes are the short messages you'd expect on twitter, mastodon, platforms like those. I will publish these on my site, and syndicate elsewhere ([POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE)). This means I'll write something on my own site, and it'll show up shortly after in several channels:
  * RSS: [https://www.erikkroes.nl/notes/feed.xml](https://www.erikkroes.nl/notes/feed.xml)
  * Mastodon: [https://mastodon.social/@erikKroes](https://mastodon.social/@erikKroes)
  * Twitter: [https://www.twitter.com/erikkroes](https://www.twitter.com/erikkroes)
  * Discord (more on that later): [https://discord.gg/ZQ2nstsE](https://discord.gg/ZQ2nstsE)
  * I also want to publish on Flickr, Pixelfed and LinkedIn but my crude setup doesn't allow that yet. I hope all this makes sure you can find my content wherever you like.
* My second action is setting up a Discord server. Discord is like a modern IRC. Or Slack but with an archive and more integrations. To be honest, I'm not a big fan. I still have a ton of options to configure and make the space as usable and inclusive as possible. But I think it's the best tool for the job right now.

## Join my Discord!

This is the part where I get you enthusiastic about joining. I mean, a place to chat is nice and all. But it's a lot nicer when I'm not alone in there.
Why I think you should join:

* You won't miss any of my writings. Both good and bad.
* You won't miss the discussion around the writings (which, honestly, is often at least as valuable)
* Brainpicking! I'll be there to share my knowledge and experience, but I hope you will be as well. I'd love to learn from you!
* Discounts. I'm looking forward to find some nice offers, specifically to share and enjoy together
* Input. I'd like to create more content, and I want the people in my Discord to suggest topics and subjects. Let me share, dive in and explain whenever possible. I prefer spending my energy on things you all care about!
* More discounts. If I'm going to make big things like books, courses and digital assets, you bet I'll drop some discounts.
* A passionate and inclusive community! I hope to gather a nice group of people (including you). It's one of the reasons I landed in the field of accessibility: so many nice people!

So join! Let's gather up some nice people and improve ourselves together. This is an invite link that works for at least 7 days, but feel free to invite other people as well! [https://discord.gg/ZQ2nstsE](https://discord.gg/ZQ2nstsE)

## Disclaimer

This is a bit of an experiment. It's something quite unusual to do (for me). I would really appreciate your input and feedback. That way I can iterate and improve things, and together we can create a nice little space on the web. Remember forums? Those were nice. Sigh.
