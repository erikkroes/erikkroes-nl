## People-first language 

Notice we talk about people with disabilities and not disabled people. This is [people-first language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People-first_language).

How a person like to be described varies and can be a matter of personal preference, but people-first language is a good starting point. It focusses on people first, and disability being factors in society. For example, a person that is unable to climb stairs is not disabled until they come into a situation where there are no alternatives to stairs.

The language opposes the classic identity-first language. In this paradigm, the focus is on the person being disabled. It tends to make the person the problem, and makes a disability a part of them. Somebody might prefer this focus on this approach. A person with autism might prefer being called autistic, as it is part of their personality. For example, somebody might prefer to be called an autistic person with asthma.

People with disabilities is clear and accepted language. Avoid euphemisms like "challenged", "differently abled", "handi-capable". There is no shame in having a disability. There is also no special or normal when it comes to disability. Such thoughts lead to [othering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy)) and are not inclusive. Anybody can be an accident of having a disability.
