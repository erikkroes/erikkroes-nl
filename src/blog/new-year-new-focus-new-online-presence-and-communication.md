This is not a new year's resolution. Holidays are just a great period for considerations!

I'm changing some things about how I do things, mostly online. The work field of accessibility is draining. And I think changing these things will make it easier for me to continue this work. I hope they will make things better for others as well.

What I have in mind:
- **Solid accessibility content is for inklusivo.** If I write a blog, a book, a training, or whatever, and it has a focus on accessibility, then it will be part of inklusivo. For context, [inklusivo](https://inklusivo.nl/) is "my" agency and foundation-in-formation through which I do my accessibility-work. It also means that the "Access Club"-Discord is even less my personal space. It's an open place for anybody to talk about accessibility.
- **I will share more less-solid content.** I think that's the best way to describe the other side of this story. My website will be more of a personal playground again. I'll write more short blogs. Less self-censorship, re-reading and re-writing. They'll probably include more typo's, and will be harder to follow. I'll be much broader in what I share and produce. Topics will likely include more lego, more art, more 3d printing, more gardening, and whatever catches the attention of my neurodiverse mind.

To clarify further, here are some RAQ (Rather Arbitrary Questions):

- What if I don't like this? Follow inklusivo. 
- Where can I do that? 
  - https://www.linkedin.com/company/inklusivo/
  - https://mastodon.social/@inklusivo
  - https://inklusivo.bsky.social
- Does this sound like a solid financial plan? Probably not.
- Sounds like fun! Agreed.
- What new stuff do you have in mind? 
  - Updating parts of my website to align with this. 
  - Accessibility courses.
  - Going to a notary and finally making inklusivo a real foundation.
  - Moving from my home office into more of an atelier/studio/makerspace
  - Producing more 3d models for 3d printings, designs for buttons/stickers/t-shirts, whatever pops up in my head. Mainly producing more!
  - Maybe revive my pixelfed-account and get back into photography.

Welcome to 2026. Welcome to my world. Enjoy, I think it's rather fun place!
