It's 2026. Let's join the flood of retrospectives!

2025 was busy, very busy. I was doing very full weeks of freelance accessibility work. That means up to 3 days working for [VodafoneZiggo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VodafoneZiggo) combined with 2 days for the Dutch Design System: [NL Design System](https://nldesignsystem.nl/).
Combine this with short-term assignments, social media, blogging, training, presenting (including [NCDT](https://www.ncdt.nl/vorige-edities/2025/35-scaled-accessibility-how-big-dutch-companies-manage-accessibility/)), supporting the Dutch accessibility community through [IDEAA11Y](https://www.meetup.com/inclusive-design-accessibility/), running a Discord server, building for [inklusivo](https://inklusivo.nl/), administration, while trying to have a family life with 2 kids who are (at minimum) as bouncy as I am. Listing all this helps me reaffirm: it's been a busy year.
VodafoneZiggo is now down to 1 day a week. I finished working for NL Design System. My agenda feels entirely different now. 

If you have something to fill my agenda again: now is the time. **I'm available for new assignments**. 2025 was busy but I actually enjoy being busy. 👀

If nobody else fills my agenda, I'm certain I will do so myself. This will include catching up on many of the things I was too busy for in 2025. Work in progress is also a **free and open course on the foundations of accessibility** for inklusivo. I'll take that experience to anouther **free and open course about social media**. Both inspired by the fact that I see way too inaccessible social media content.
I'm also working in an **extensive paid course based on [Solid Start](https://www.solidstart.info/)**. Personally, I'm really looking forward to inhabit our "atelier"-space that's been filled with boxes from moving almost 4 years ago. It's also very much time to turn inklusivo into a real foundation (visiting a notary and whatever it takes).
For more on my personal plans, you could read my previous blog [New year. New focus. New online presence and communication.](https://www.erikkroes.nl/blog/new-year-new-focus-new-online-presence-and-communication/) Possible new/old ventures include 3d modeling, 3d printing, photography/art and more sharing than before. I always love more sharing!

Got any ideas, contributions or suggestions? Please let me know. Let's make 2026 even more inclusive!
