Musical running tip!

- Most dance/trance is around 130BPM. That translates to a low cadence
- Happy hardcore/gabber is mostly around 160BPM, much better already
- Want a higher cadence? Modern hardstyle and drum'n'bass do well for 170BPM!

(Yes, I have a playlist with 170 BPM songs for running ðŸš€)
