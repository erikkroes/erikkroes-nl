Alt text is not what you add to an image. It's what you start with.

My process for writing alt text is my process for adding images. It might feel backwards. 

1. Define what you want to communicate. (This is your alt text)
2. Find an image that communicates that.

Add the alt text to your image. Now if the image can't be seen, your message is still there. The alt text is not some kind of "second-class citizen" and afterthought. It's the message you intend to communicate in the first place!
