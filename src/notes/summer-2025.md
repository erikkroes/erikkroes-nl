Summer time!

I've got about 20 blogspost in mind, that I want videos of as well.
There's writing a free foundational "introduction to accessibility"-course
And a free "accessible social media"-course
And a more extensive paid course

Oh, and 2 weeks of Northern Italy!

What are your summer plans? ðŸ˜‡
