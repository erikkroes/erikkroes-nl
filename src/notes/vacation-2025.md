What a week in the Dolomites has taught me about accessibility..

Living in the flat and low Netherlands might be how I came to this insight: mountains are just amazing. 

Accessibility is fun and all. It feels pretty good to include 20-25% of the world population. (Try it sometime!)

But if I could pick between working on accessibility in a flat country, or being in the mountains. Well... 
If you could all make sure my agenda for 2026 is filled with remote work, that would be great üëçüèø

That was my 2025 summer vacation. Charged up and ready to do stuff. Client work and lots of content sharing planned. 

What is everybody else working on? Can I do anything to support you?
