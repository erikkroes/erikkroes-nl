If your collapsible looks anything like this, please reconsider.

Make interactive elements recognizable as such. People will not see/understand that little chevron when it's far away. Especially when they're zoomed in, have issues with vision and/or focus.

Give it a clear border, different colours, different font weight or anything to make it stand out more and clarify it's a grouping. If you add a chevron (or a plus-sign), keep it close to the content.
