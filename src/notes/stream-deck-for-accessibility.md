title: stream deck for accessibility

🤔 Considering a new article/guide on using a stream deck (little device with bunch of buttons) for accessibility auditing.

☎️ I've got some thoughts. But what kind of shortcuts/actions do you use extremely often? Which would you like to access at the press of a button?
