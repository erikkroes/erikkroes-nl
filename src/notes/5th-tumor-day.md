ðŸŽ‰ Happy tumor day for those who celebrate!

5 years since my last surgery already. Blessed with a second kid, built a house, shattered my elbow and this COVID-thing happened

Proud & happy with my amazing family. Curious what the next 5 will bring!

ðŸ¤” might celebrate by planting a small forest
