The Dutch Inclusive Design & Accessibility meetup (IDEA11Y) can't exist without support. To make contributions easier, we've made a form for submitting and sharing.

Is there something you can/want to contribute? (Speaking, a location, something else?) That would be much appreciated!

(And please, share it as well!)
