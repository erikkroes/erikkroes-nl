![An image with 2 panels. In the first it compares a tiny planet Mercury to the enormous sun. The second looks like the first, but in this case it's a tiny button to close a popup, and an enormous fingertip.](/assets/media/ab11eb49-0394-4c44-903e-c8250e39ce1e.png)

I will ha.. strongly dislike your popup when:

* Escape doesn't close it
* Clicking the background doesn't close it
* The close button is sized like this
