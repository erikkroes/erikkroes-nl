alt: A picture of my workspace. Two vertical windows to the left. A desk to the
  right. It features two screens, a microphone, a stream deck and the usual
  things. I should make a list. Shelves show lego, plants, some books and a fake
  picasso print.

I've been looking forward to share a picture of my workspace. It's been a work in progress. It's pretty cleaned up, and I'm afraid plants will die again soon. So best time to post is now 😬

It's my happy space and I love working from home. 🙏🏿
