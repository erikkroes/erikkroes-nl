One step can ruin an entire journey. 

I love being positive. Every bit of accessibility-effort makes a website better! ðŸ¦¾

But for an entire journey to be accessible, it needs to be considered from start to finish.

(Also nice, when you no longer post to twitter. You can reupload old images! ðŸŽ‰)
