I've had the pleasure to support VodafoneZiggo in their journey towards EAA-compliance. For over a year I've worked with some great people from Accessibility Foundation.

Every week is full of new and exciting challenges. It's not just web, or e-commerce. It's broadcasting, advertisting, physical products and services, telecommunications, and so much more!

Not exactly sure how, but I still had some mental space left. So I'm very happy and proud to share that I've also started contributing to NL Design System!

We're delivering a top notch design system for Dutch government and beyond!

So very nice to be able to combine accessibility and design systems in one of the largest ways and most impactful ways possible!
