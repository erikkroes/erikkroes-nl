There's a lot to say about trumps recent decisions and how they impact minorities. More than fits in a short message. This is another low point today:

"The word ‘talent’ — you have to be talented, naturally talented geniuses.” 

Blaming diversity and inclusion for a plane crash, because we can't be talented? Disgusted.
