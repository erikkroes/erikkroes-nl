title: active contrast
---

☯ Designer tip: when a component has increased attention, give it -more- contrast!

🔎 Don't make contrast lower when something is hovered over, focussed on, or in any other situation where the user is probably using it. Make it stand out more, instead of less! Make it appear and grab attention, not vanish!
