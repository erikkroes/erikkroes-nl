Complex solutions require diversity. Stop and start doing these things to hire neurodiverse people.

(Because traditional approaches won't reach neurodiverse people. And you want those, especially for your accessibility-related job openings)

The first step is to stop your urge. Don't get spammy impersonal recruiters. Nobody likes them in the first place (sorry). But this works even worse for lots of neurodiverse people.

And you do want diversity in your workforce. Including people in the workforce, means diverse opinions in the workplace, means healthier culture with more inclusive products. An inclusive offering starts at inclusive hiring and onboarding.


So what should you do?

- A personal approach
- Answer questions
- Be clear about expectations and the process
- Mention not just what you expect, but what you offer as well (salary, work from home)
- Encourage people to apply, even when they don't meet all requirements
- Follow up, always
- Ask as little as possible (no superfluous questions or meetings; energy and focus are precious)

Nothing shocking. Treat people like people. Make no assumptions. Be clear, open and welcoming!

(Yes, that image is a Lego set. Modern Lego, to me, is a great example of how diversity can lead to impressive and intricate results. The offering is waaaay beyond the traditional 2x4 bricks these days, and see what people are able to produce with such a wide variety of elements.)
