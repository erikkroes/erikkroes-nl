🤔 Google weakens ad blockers in Chrome

🥳 I'm happy about that for me. Chrome is the de facto standard browsers they use to develop all their things. If they check their ads in Chrome, I can probably still block them easily in my FireFox.

🤫 FireFox + uBlock + Privacy Badger + Pi-hole. I like my internet quiet.
