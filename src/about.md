Hi, I'm Erik. I'm a photographer and creative in the world of accessibility. I like to:

- Sink my teeth into a challenge
- Get the most out of people and situations
- Create structure where there is none
- Use bulleted lists

What I don't like is writing about myself but let's try it anyway.

Erik Kroes is a specialist in accessibility and design systems, and enjoys to combining the two. He lives in the Netherlands where he works as a Product Owner of the Design Systems at ING. Whatever time is left is mostly spent with his family. Personal projects include photography, gardening, generative art and creative programming.
