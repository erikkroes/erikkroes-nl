This flowchart tries to help you with the question: does the European Accessibility Act (EAA) apply?

## What is the EAA?

The European accessibility act covers <strong>products and services</strong> that have been identified as being most important for persons with disabilities while being most likely to have diverging accessibility requirements across EU countries.

The Commission consulted stakeholders and experts on accessibility and took into account the obligations deriving from the [UN convention on persons with disabilities](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1138&langId=en).

## Assumptions
This is meant for businesses that need external motivation (like laws) to make ethical choices, and operate in the EU.

## The flowchart (needs better title)

Let's find out if EAA applies to your product or service.

    <p>Computers are electronic devices that process information, designed for a broad range of home and office applications like web browsing, email, word processing, gaming, etc. Computer hardware is split up into desktop-PCs and portable PCs, which can in turn be split up into laptops and tablets.

    <p>operating systemâ€™ means software, which, inter alia, handles the interface to peripheral hardware, schedules tasks, allocates storage, and presents a default interface to the user when no application program is running including a graphical user interface, regardless of whether such software is an integral part of consumer general purpose computer hardware, or constitutes free-standing software intended to be run on consumer general purpose computer hardware, but excluding an operating system loader, basic input/output system, or other firmware required at boot time or when installing the operating system; https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019L0882#d1e1259-70-1</p>

            <dd>No. Then legally, you can probably get away without being accessible. You're still an asshole though.
