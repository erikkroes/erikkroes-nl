This flowchart tries to help you with the question: does the European Accessibility Act (EAA) apply?

## What is the EAA?

The European accessibility act covers <strong>products and services</strong> that have been identified as being most important for persons with disabilities while being most likely to have diverging accessibility requirements across EU countries.

The Commission consulted stakeholders and experts on accessibility and took into account the obligations deriving from the [UN convention on persons with disabilities](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1138&langId=en).

## Assumptions
This is meant for businesses that need external motivation (like laws) to make ethical choices, and operate in the EU.

## The flowchart (needs better title)

Let's find out if EAA applies to your product or service.

<dl>
  <dt><h3>Is your product or service a computer or operating system?</h3></dt>
  <dd>Yes, the EAA applies. Get started -></dd>
  <dd>No
    <dl>
      <dt><h3>Are we talking about a payment terminal, automated teller machine, ticketing machine, check-in machine or an interactive self-service terminals providing information?</h3></dt>
      <dd>Yes, the EAA applies. Get started -></dd>
      <dd>No
          <dl>
            <dt>Question 3 that summarizes a complicated situation, but also offers resources to dive in further.</dt>
            <dd>Yes, the EAA applies. Get started -></dd>
            <dd>No. Then legally, you can probably get away without being accessible. You're still an asshole though.
            </dd>
