title: A glossary of web accessibility terms
layout: pages/glossary.njk

Web accessibility has lots of specific terms, abbreviations and other jargon. This glossary clarifies some of them, and more. Further resources are added where available.

This page is very much a "living document"; it's intended to be updated and improved constantly. Your questions and contributions are much appreciated!
As it's due to change, bookmarking is probably more valuable than printing. You could also save some trees that way.
